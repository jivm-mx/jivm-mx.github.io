## 02. Painting

## 03. Simulation: One-dimensional motion

[Demonstrate a simple ball movement simulation by changing the position within the window width at specific intervals.](./03_moveBall/)

[Now, the ball moves on the x and y-axis, along with edge detection.](./03_moveBall/)

## 05. Simulation: Bonus exercise
