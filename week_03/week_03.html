    <td>Learn to load other files on the current page (CSS and JS). Create balls that move under gravity and bounce off the walls. Each ball is stored in an array and created with a random color, at a specific location with specific velocity, under specific gravity conditions.</td>

    <td><a href="./03_randomWalk/randomWalk.html" alt="03 random Walk">Random walk: Projectile exercise</a></td>
    <td>Exploration on how molecules move randomly (as in a sneeze) across the screen. Added boundaries, gravity, speed (so the virus particles drop to the ground and travel at various sneeze speeds), plus code refactoring.</td>
  </tr>

    <td><a href="./03_randomWalk/randomWalk2.html" alt="04 random Walk2">Random Walk 2: Tracking projectile trajectory</a></td>
    <td>Now, we're tracking particles within boundaries, plus code refactoring. Click within the rectangle to create them.</td>

    <td>2D scenario, in which the particles emulate an explosion (big bang) and its contraction (big crunch).</td>
