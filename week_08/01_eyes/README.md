# Eyes exercise

Prettier & ESLint plugin for VSCode assisted in the refactoring of this code.

## Description

Have you felt that someone is looking at you? Now, your mouse arrow will be followed by two fierce eyes, which are decided to not lose sight of it.

Using JavaScript and CSS, one can define elements and arrange them within the page to create this dynamic experience.

This exercise work best on non-touch screens (touchscreen users need to tap in order to see the eyes moving).

## How to run

You can download this folder and open the index.html file on a browser (Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome).

- Move your mouse over the screen.
- On touch screens, tap any part of the screen to make the eyes move to that point.

## Roadmap

Refactor the code.
