# Pacmen exercise

Prettier & ESLint plugin for VSCode assisted in the refactoring of this code.

## Description

What would happen if you could create as many Pacman's as you want and then see them bouncing off the screen edges? In this exercise, one can make a Pacman by pressing the button 'Add Pacman'; every Pacman is a randomly selected image placed within a div element.

It updates its position based on initial velocity random values. When an edge is reached, Pacman will bounce off.

## How to run

You can download this folder and open the index.html file on this folder on a browser (Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome).

- To add a Pacman, click on the "Add Pacman" button.
- To start the game, click on the "Start Game" button.

## Roadmap
